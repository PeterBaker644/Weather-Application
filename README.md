# Weather Dashboard

This is a responsive, mobile-friendly web-based weather application that allows the user to view the local weather, 5 day forecast, and search for the weather anywhere else in the world. The dashboard includes a feature that allows the user to save past searches for future use. It displays the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and uv index with color warnings. The application also displays the current time the local weather was last polled at the top of the screen.
